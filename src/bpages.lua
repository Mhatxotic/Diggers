      revolutionary substance called TNT to display it's pages. (See TNT.) \z

      TNT and the control mechanism for TNT which are 3 cut emeralds that \z
      are embedded into the spine of the Book.\n\z
      \n\z
      The top emerald returns the reader to the index page.\n\z
      The 2nd emerald moves the reader to the next page.\n\z
      The third emerald takes the reader back to the previous page."

      \n\z
      Recently strengthened by a merger with the Badland Bank, the Zargon \z
      Bank has gone from strength to strength and has expanded it's \z
      operations to include stock market facilities. The Zargon Bank now \z
      controls all money transactions on the planet and has devised a \z
      savings plan for all its customers. The slightly unusual thing about \z
      this plan is that it is mandatory.\n\z
      \n\z
      When a digger opens a current CASH account, the bank opens a savings \z
      STASH account for that customer. The bank will then automatically \z
      transfer a percentage of all CASH and save it in the STASH account. \z

      When a mining operation is first started, the Bank is quite prepared \z
      to make a loan of 100 credits to the Master Miner. However, the Master \z
      Miner must repay the loan at the end of each successful digging \z
      operation within a zone.\n\z

      services of the Bank in providing a loan.\n\z

      The Bank also operates a generous Trade-in policy for capital \z
      equipment, (lifts, mining machines, etc). Assuming a Master Miner is \z
      successful in completing a mining area, they would not wish to leave \z
      behind all the equipment purchased to complete their operations. \z
      Therefore, the Bank arranges for it's valuers to wisit the mine, \z

      The Zargon Stock Market follows the rules of supply ano demand like \z
      all other stock markets. It Is linked to a network of other markets \z
      throughout the galaxy, as a result mineral trading and mineral prices \z
      are often affected by dealings and incidents on other planets.\n\z
      \n\z
      Above the bank tellers is a display showing the minerals or jewels \z
      currently being traded by that teller. Selecting the display shows \z
      you the value for that mineral or jewel. Selecting the teller will \z
      enable you to sell any mineral or jewel that you may have."

      the market and lower the gold's value.\n\z

      One precious stone always retains it's value however Jennite, a pink \z
      jewel, is extremely rare and hence very valuable and so you will find \z
